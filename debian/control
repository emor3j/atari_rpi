Description: USB to Atari mouse adapter for Raspberry Pi
 This package provides a USB to Atari mouse adapter that allows modern USB
 mice to work with Atari computers. The program reads USB mouse events and
 converts them to Atari-compatible signals output through the Raspberry Pi's
 GPIO pins.
 .
 The adapter handles mouse movement and button clicks, making it possible to
 use contemporary USB mice with vintage Atari systems that expect the original
 Atari mouse protocol.
