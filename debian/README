# Atari RPI Project

## Overview

The Atari RPI project provides modern hardware interfaces for classic Atari ST 
platforms using Raspberry Pi GPIO capabilities. This project bridges the gap 
between vintage Atari ST systems and contemporary peripherals, allowing users 
to enhance their retro computing experience with modern convenience.

## Project Components

### atari_usb_mouse
Converts USB mouse events into quadrature signals compatible with Atari ST 
mouse ports. This utility allows you to use modern USB mice with original 
Atari ST hardware by translating mouse movements and button presses into 
the appropriate GPIO signals.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO support)
- Atari ST system
- Appropriate wiring/interface between Raspberry Pi GPIO and Atari ST ports
- USB peripherals (mouse, etc.)

## System Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS or compatible Linux distribution
- GPIO access permissions
- Input device access permissions

## Installation

This package provides the necessary utilities and documentation. Individual 
applications can be run directly or configured as system services.

## Applications

### atari_usb_mouse
See `/usr/share/doc/atari-rpi/atari_usb_mouse.README` for detailed information 
about USB mouse support.

Manual page: `man atari_usb_mouse`

## Configuration

Each application provides example configuration files in JSON format. These 
can be found in `/usr/share/doc/atari-rpi/` with the `.ex` extension.

Copy and modify these files according to your hardware setup and requirements.

## Support and Documentation

- Application-specific README files: `/usr/share/doc/atari-rpi/`
- Manual pages: `man <application_name>`
- Configuration examples: `/usr/share/doc/atari-rpi/`
